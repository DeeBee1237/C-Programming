These are some of the C Programs I have worked on in one of my Networking Courses.
Decode.c and Encode.c hade a small amount of code that the lecturer wrote 
and we had to fill in the rest ourselves. The first two C files are used to implement
an encryption algorithm that combines a Caeser Cypher and a removal of duplicate chars (
duplicates are removed from the message and then a caeser cypher is applied
)
